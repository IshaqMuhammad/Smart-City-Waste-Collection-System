# Smart City Waste Collection System  
*A semester-project for Data Structures & Algorithms using graph models, MST, Kruskal’s & Prim’s algorithms to optimise waste-collection path.*

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a waste-collection routing optimisation system for a smart city scenario. It latitude and longitude of the bins or collection points and uses Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and tree/path-finding techniques (Kruskal’s & Prim’s) to compute an efficient route for collection.  
The aim is to reduce travel distance/time for waste-collection vehicles, thereby improving efficiency and lowering cost for municipal collection services.

## ⚙️ Features  
- Represent the city waste-collection network as a graph (nodes = collection points / bins, edges = roads with weights)  
- Compute an MST of the graph using Prim’s and/or Kruskal’s algorithm to identify a backbone route  
- Derive an optimal (or near-optimal) collection path from the MST (or augmented route)  
- Provide input files/scripts to define the graph (nodes, edges, weights)  
- GUI / command line interface (depending on implementation) to visualise or output the route  
- Database sync / persistent storage of graph data (via SQL script)
